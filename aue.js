  "verseDescriptions": [
    ["a", `I find this really important right now, in the early days of Aue being shared, where it's conceivable only I have read Aue and understood.
    <b>Here, use intelligence & sensibility.</b> It's a very direct verse, calling upon innate abilities we all have, to discover Aue. Aue is not written for its face value, it is written to be read again & again until understood, with sensibility – a serious attitude. <b>Here, use intelligence & sensibility.</b>
    The interpretations encourage a regular revision of Aue in respect to one's life, and publicly so.`],
    ["b", `This verse is cited in the first five interpretations of Aue, and touches upon not just its own propagation, but also on a time which can be really hard to keep faith - austerity.
    One may read Aue, understand, and benefit, but when times are tough it can be easy to drop empathy and abandon any "peace-time" morals. Aue has no conditional clause saying "have faith, only when times are good"; you are asked to have faith not only in Aue, but yourself - your own ability to understand.
    With revision you should have made peace with the knowledge Aue provides, so even in the hardest times, or the quickest judgements, you can rely on it. It also asks that you remain humble when times are good, and not to shun Aue or others.
    Other citations to it are to its propagation and celebration. You must have faith in its meaning, and your understanding, if you are to teach it without restraint, to translate it without misjudgement, to celebrate it without feeling false. Thankfully, with group and personal revision, few should be unable to do this!
    Have faith in Aue & your ability to understand`],
    ["c", `This verse, like the previous two, focus mostly on gaining a position in your life, and its propagation to others. It claims to inspire joy, and so this should be shared and preserved.
    What is sharing? It is making it accessible to others. Translation, summaries, conversation, and education are all important facets of this.
    What is preservation of knowledge? It is immortalising through accurate copies, guarded from misunderstanding. Language changes, and English is no exception.
    And now is a good time to focus on a core concept of Aue: <b>joy</b>. A state of happiness, felicity, it is mentioned throughout Aue, coveted. Further verses will allude to its relationship with <b>woe</b>. Aue asks in verse <i>k</i>: <b>Know of woe, & seek out joy with joy & praise.</b>
    Therefore an Auen should include these revelations and praises in their revisions, summaries, and always remember what Aue clearly states to be: <b>This is knowledge, to share, preserve, for joy.</b>`],
    ["d", `Remarkably not the shortest verse in Aue, it states that because you now have access to the Aue doctrine that you could rejoice. However, do not mistaken pointing at the moon for the moon itself! The first time you read this verse you won't be feeling particularly joyful.
    Remember, Aue is to be revised and read over and over until it makes sense for you. Each time you read across this verse - and you should, as all are important - you will hopefully feel the joy has grown. And, one might also feel the need to impart this knowledge onto others as I am.
    Two new interpretations that cite this verse are <i>Reflection</i> and <i>Gratitude</i>. These constitute a reflection upon reality, and particularly a gratuitous reflection for those who bring you joy. Gratitude has a fairly weak citation, but just as you might feel joy for Aue, rejoice for other things in life - a recurring cycle. Aue is all about seeing the wonderful opportunity for joy we were born into, and the capacity we have for it, with billions of fellow humans, an uncountable number of other beings, and having been born from the exact conditions for our livelihood.
    And so I do sincerely hope, dear reader, you will be able to feel some joy; <b>it is shared to you, rejoice!</b>`],
    ["e", `Aue has asked an adherent to rejoice for Aue being shared to them, and now it asks that one record and preach the joy. What is the joy? It's not just this joy - the sharing. The joy it speaks of is all that you discover through the lens of Aue. In further verses one is asked to seek out joy in response to woe, and to demonstrate Aue in response to woeful behaviour. Further, we are asked to do this with joy and praise.
    <b>Record & preach the joy.</b> Why? To help the propagation of Aue and therefore the joy that comes with it, and to codify appraisal and history. One could quietly and solitarily follow Aue, but that would virtually denying any benefits one experiences for others.`],
    ["f", `Ephemeral uniqueness. This is the first of the substantial verses of Aue which make hard assertions. One can also tell this by seeing it is the first citation of five heavily-referenced interpretations. The shape and size of verse references can tell you a lot about its nature. 
    Aue has a materialistic view of the world, rooted in science; the human brain is certainly theoretically capable of being conscious, smart, emotional, etc, as a self-contained organ. 
    This verse is about the miraculous existence of us as individuals, and of nature, our eventual waste, and the impracticality of our reformation after the fact. Our bodies aren't very unique and have been replicated billions of times, but our personalities are a distinct artefact. Alas, they are bound to our organic constitution, currently susceptible to total decay. After this decay, the unique cluster of brain matter constituting our individuality is lost.
    The interpretations of this verse address <i>perimortem</i> (just before and after death) issues of us and nature. The protection of what we have now through <i>Ecology</i>; dashing the futile wish for your corpse to be undisturbed (as it shall be anyway); the first of many reasons why bodily violation is a disturbing wrong; why one should keep healthy if wishing to preserve one's existence; and, if not wanting to preserve your existence, being assisted to expedite its end.`],
    ["g", `Leading on after verse <i>f</i> is a reminder of death. Not just the death of us, but of all beings, and nature as a whole.
    It is the harsh reality that from now until the heat death of the universe, our unique, contiguous consciousnesses won't reform. Assuredly, each mundane atom of one's mind and body will seep into nature, eventually subside into the Earth's mantle just before its almost total destruction through the inflation of the Sun. Beyond this, for trillions of years, it will not matter - you will have scattered long ago.
    The new interpretations citing <i>g</i> draw upon this.`],
    ["h", `Some may wonder why there is joy and woe in the world at the same time, why it is experienced unequally. It is simply nature and the fittest way to survive our environments. Plants and even microbes will respond to positive and negative stimuli &mdash; a dichotomy which we intelligent beings apply. They do not understand what is positive and negative, with only genetic impetus. These genes are the product of innumerable mutations alongside innumerable environmental pressures &mdash; evolution, primitive. Our acute sense of joy and woe is owed to our consciousness.
    The most familiar yet most mysterious aspect of our lives is consciousness. An arguably beautiful character of this is empathy - a linchpin of both society and Aue. It is not just good for good's sake, but a winning trait of our species. The interpretations commencing with a <i>h</i> citation encourage this good both in oneself and for others. <i>Phobias</i> encourages addressing irrational fears; <i>Charity</i> encourages material aid and ongoing easement for those in need; <i>Veganism</i> strictly encourages reducing harm to animals currently enslaved through societal inertia; <i>Abortion</i> addresses pregnancy and its termination as valuable only before it could effect woe &mdash; thankfully plenty of time to make a decision.`],
    ["i", `This verse again repeats the idea that life evolves, but that's not its statement. It's reminding us that live evolves together, in the same universe. We have effects on one another, between species, sizes, ages, and location. We share the precious conditions we have, and therefore should be conscious of our effects.
    The previously seen interpretations here, such as <i>Ecology</i>, <i>Veganism</i>, etc, focus on these relationships to bolster good. The new interpretations include defining a relationship between parents and offspring; encouraging cooperation over competition; a reminder of our actions impacting those in the future; of participating in research as we are of one another; and a small refutation on the nature of our seemingly designed universe—life, evolved together, shares (and have shared) the universe. 
    Of course, it is up to us to be good. There is no supernatural tally of virtue & sin, karma, and only through empathy (no small thing) and utilitarianism will we bolster good.`],
    ["j", `As previous verses have established, after death is scattering, and it is a certainty for all of us. Maybe advances in medicine will improve our lifespans within our lifetime, but even with an extra 100 years, or 1000 years, or one trillion, our time is volatile and short. This means weshould take care to use our life well, and realise how precious it is.
    With previous interpretations, four interpretations commencing with <i>j</i> are <i>Slavery</i>, to help ensure nobody lives their life without freedom; <i>Shame</i> to help ensure nobody restricts their life choices just because others feel offended; <i>Exercise</i> a short simple encouragement for the gym to not just waste energy on resistance; <i>Technological inertia</i> encourages being aware of (seeking) socially valuable technology that should be adopted without delay, factoring in hardships.
    More interpretations may draw upon this verse just to remind people to not waste their lives. Even I must be reminded sometimes.`],
    ["k", `All a religion without supernatural means can do is inspire—move—one to act and think differently. Aue is no exception. Its ~140 words can only be written in a way that after multiple readings and studies it first makes sense, then causes change. Of course you could approach anybody on the street and say: <b>Know of woe, & seek joy with joy & praise.</b> But while this verse is one of the most important, it is only words, and it's up to the adherent to effect its importance.
    In religion there is often dichotomy between good & evil, virtue & sin, and joy & woe is of Aue. <b>Know of woe</b> is an entire life's journey with conscious, empathetic heart and mind.  It means to uncover all national plight, all manner of personal grievance, and even the condition of life itself. <b>& seek joy</b> is on this same path, to effect it in both yourself and others. with joy & praise is to actually derive joy and praise your journey between woe and joy, and help others follow the same path.
    You've read the words. <i>a</i> <b>Here, use intelligence & sensibility;</b> read them again.`],
    ["l", `To me, religion requires faith. And to me, this is the core faith of Aue.
    There is a compulsion in modern, especially capitalist society, to become alienated from all but yourself. And yet as human beings we would be completely unrecognisable without society, and nonexistent without nature.
    Society is the sum of all our interactions with one another, and can be shared with anybody except by yourself alone. By trusting & relying on nature & society, we accept a part of ourselves just as important as our flesh.
    <b>Trust & rely on nature & society</b> as you already depend on them, and must recognise the dependency.`],
    ["m", `One might find it apparent to oppose harm to others, but this verse serves as the steadfast reminder. Aue lays out the character of joy & woe, and asks for this to be consistently kept in mind, and its diversity investigated.
    The <b>it</b> is <b>nature & society</b> (<i>l</i>), with sentient beings making up that society. Opposing harm and bolstering good involves numerous actions.
    Taking anthropogenic climate change as a currently most important issue, it will take massive corrections and pressures in our behaviour and governance to address. The normalisation and unnecessary systematic torture and slaughter of billions of animals globally must be addressed. Hundreds of millions of individuals globally are suffering in war, persecution, genocide, poverty, economic debt or slavery, and more, and must be saved. And locally, there may be individuals or families in need which can be directly helped. These issues, an adherent of Aue should tackle head-on, for joy.
    But how much should one change? Where is the line drawn? This is a question that can regress into a return to primitive life or even to excuse suicide. But this insults our capacity for doing good, and may make one feel apathetic. We all have the ability to seek out, prioritise, and create real lasting impact in this world. It is with faith that adherents of Aue should do this, and never stop. <i>b</i> <b>Have faith in Aue & your abilities.</b>`],
    ["n", `Empathy is a fantastic evolved ability which enables understanding, and gives sensation of situations from other beings' perspectives. It gives both joy & woe to its practitioners, of which Aue encourages you feel and understand.
    <b>Have empathy</b> is thankfully not an empty statement - its strength per individual is affected by both nature and nurture. Learning empathy, and all its forms, is what Aue encourages. Others' emulation of empathy is to encourage it in all beings. It is not a force of good on its own (compassion), as some beings think less of themselves and so likely others. Aue is to tactically instil joy in others so we benefit from the synergy of societal joy.`],
    ["o", `Unfortunately, it's virtually impossible for all animals (us included) to behave in such a way that woe is reduced only to natural misfortune. Whether through nature or nurture, some of us have taken a vocation of causing harm to others, whether that be permanently unpleasant attitude or serial murder. This verse serves as a reminder, that woe is not just inherent to our mortal condition but can be caused by others. Thankfully there is a human capacity to bring only joy to others to some degree.
    This verse may address a victim or a culprit. For a victim, there is reminder that <i>some</i> woe is malicious, calculated, but therefore subject to change. For a culprit, there is no inherent virtue or sin, no eternal damnation, karma or curses, and therefore opportunity to change.`],
    ["p", `<b>Some woe is incited or inflicted</b>, and as the previous thoughts summarised, it is acceptable to recognise some people act maliciously. Aue asks that you protect yourself, and the things & people in your life that bring you joy, as a first step. It is a call to resistance through defence, to not bow to fate, and to ensure there are systems and relationships in place to actively defend against inflicted woe. Truly capable subverting of societal joy is by other social beings; seeking less belligerence is a vital dialectical, and unfortunately sometimes attritional, process.`],
    ["q", `Ignorance is not malicious; we are all ignorant of things in varying degrees. However, perpetual ignorance, either upon yourself or others, we have seen does contribute to woe. This may be in the way we interact with others socially, opinions and mannerisms we inherit, continuing to do something we know is wrong, not questioning something we've been informed may be wrong, not speaking up or intervening in a situation we know is preventable.
    Most of the time, we're all correct and taking a path which is unharmful beyond reasonable doubt. But it's those minority instances that can change you and the lives of others dramatically. Aue asks one to be aware of woe, and act on it; exhibit this to others in the face of ignorance. This means to demonstrate, not to judge, nor chastise, nor force.`],
    ["r", `To me, <b>faith in science</b> is not an oxymoron. Interacting with all other people we have ingrained in us a workable level of trust for relationships, business, peace, and guardianship, among others. It is no law of physics—you have my word—that money guarantees service, affection guarantees loyalty, or that treaties are eternal. This in mind, the human pursuits of science and academia do not guarantee truth.
    It has been very apparent in lay and opposing peoples that distrust of institutions and authority lead to distrust in otherwise sound method and reproducibility.
    Though Antiscience is a pestilence, how the most critically acclaimed, even benign institutions are verified and trusted should be understood, countering blind trust. This will only be good for our society as a whole.
    With this ever-critical faith, we can be more sure of the conclusions of specialists and experts, institutions, and foundational knowledge, for joy. Scientific method and knowledge are inexorable for achieving effective adherence to Aue.`],
    ["s", `This final verse of Aue follows after asking for critical trust in science and knowledge. Aue up until now has asked for one to be increasingly well aware of the joy and woe in this world, to side for society's joy, and propagate these priorities. It has also made various assertions, tying into this, about our origins, drives, and endings, which are rooted in materialist understanding. Aue itself certainly has intention of using materialist conclusions as solutions.
    This verse isn't stating that science automatically wields itself for joy, or intrinsically impedes woe, rather it is an invitation to this cause; we must grow it. To quote Albert Einstein:
    “Science … cannot create ends and, even less, instill them in human beings; science, at most, can supply the means by which to attain certain ends. But the ends themselves are conceived by personalities with lofty ethical ideals and—if these ends are not stillborn, but vital and vigorous—are adopted and carried forward by those many human beings who, half unconsciously, determine the slow evolution of society.”`]
